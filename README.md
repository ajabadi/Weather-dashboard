In this week's challenge, developers are tasked with creating a weather forecast website by integrating a third-party API, specifically the OpenWeather API, to retrieve weather data for cities. The task involves using the 5-day weather forecast to display both current and future weather conditions for a searched city. To ensure persistent data, localStorage is utilized to store search history.

To start, a starter code isn't provided, requiring the creation of the HTML and CSS structure from scratch. The goal is to build a weather dashboard featuring form inputs to search for cities.

Functionality:

Input: A search bar to input city names.
Action: Searching for a city triggers the display of current and future weather conditions for that specific city.
Result: The searched city is added to the search history for quick access.
